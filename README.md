# kibana-sso-proxy
kibana-sso-proxy is a lightweight authentication proxy that sits in front of Kibana and enables OIDC-based Single Sign-On (SSO) without requiring paid Elastic features. It is designed for Kubernetes and containerized environments, supports common OIDC providers, and can be deployed as a standalone service, sidecar, or ingress-auth layer.
